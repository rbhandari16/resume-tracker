## Phase 4 — Row Level Security (RLS)

RLS enforces strict data ownership:

- Users can access only their own applications.
- Events derive ownership via applications.
- Resume versions are readable by authenticated users.
- Service role bypasses RLS (backend only).

This ensures multi-user isolation and secure event tracking.
